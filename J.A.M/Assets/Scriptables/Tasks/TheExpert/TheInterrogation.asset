  descriptionTask: The Expert didn't find us by chance... He says he has a vision
    that told him about the Artifact's trajectory. One thing's for sure, the Military
    can't let this man free with such knowledge. On the other hand, researchers could
    need a person with a connexion to the Artifact.
